1. ARP Poisoning Attack Overview:
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning is a type of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack used to intercept or manipulate network traffic between two systems. In this attack, the attacker sends falsified ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network, typically the gateway or a victim system. Once the attacker successfully poisons the ARP cache, they can intercept, modify, or block traffic between the victim's device and the network gateway.

2. Packet Capture and Analysis:
After successfully establishing an ARP poisoning attack, the network traffic between the victim's IP address and the gateway is intercepted. This intercepted traffic, which may include sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, or session tokens, is captured and stored in a .pcap (Packet Capture) file. The .pcap file serves as a record of the network packets and can be analyzed offline for further insights.

3. Scanning for Vulnerabilities Using Nmap:
To identify potential vulnerabilities on the victim's system, the attacker employs Nmap (Network Mapper), a powerful network scanning tool. Nmap is used to perform a scan of the victim's open ports, services, and operating system details. The results from Nmap provide valuable information, such as:

List of open ports on the victim's system.
Active services running on those ports.
The operating system and its version.
This information can help the attacker identify potential exploits or weaknesses in the victim's system.

4. Packet Analysis Using Pyshark:
To process the intercepted packets, Pyshark, a Python wrapper for the Wireshark packet analysis tool, is utilized. Pyshark simplifies the task of programmatically analyzing packets in the .pcap file. Key activities include:

Extracting source and destination IP addresses.
Identifying protocols used in the intercepted traffic (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
Summarizing packet types and their frequency to understand the nature of the communication.
Pyshark's automation capabilities make it easier to sift through large volumes of data to pinpoint sensitive or unusual traffic patterns.

5. Employing Social Engineering Techniques:
Alongside technical methods, social engineering tactics are used to gather sensitive information. These techniques involve psychological manipulation of individuals to gain access to confidential information. Examples include:

Sending phishing emails to deceive the victim into sharing login credentials.
Redirecting the victim to malicious websites during the ARP poisoning attack.
Crafting messages that exploit trust or fear to extract sensitive details exchanged over the network.
6. Implications and Precautions:
The ARP poisoning attack and associated activities pose significant risks to network security, including unauthorized data access, credential theft, and system compromise. To mitigate these risks, the following precautions should be implemented:
